This is the Perl native module for MidWay.  MidWay must be installed
in order for this module to compile.

And of course you must have perl 5.00X or better installed.
I've developed with 5.00503

Installation:
-------------

Unpack at a temp directory, since you're reading this, you probably
already done so.

run perl Makefile.PL

This created a lot of stuff that your not meant to understand, unless
you're accustomed to perl XS modules. What is important is that this
creates a Makefile.

run make

now you can test it by using the -I option to perl, like
perl -I blib/arch/auto/MidWay/ test.pl

If you're satisfied, install it into the perl lib three by running

make install

You must MOST likely be root to run this step, or you've a broken perl
installation.



That's all folks!!!!!
