The shell server - a MidWay server that allows services to be implemented with shell command lines

The shell server is intended to be used for R&D, testing, prototyping, not for general production.



Build with
$ make

You might have to set C_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH if MidWay is installed in an unstandard place. 

Unless you know what you're doing, don't install mw_shell_server with rest of MidWay.
See CAVEAT_EMPTOR.

See EXAMPLES of how to use.
